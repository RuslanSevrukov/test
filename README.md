##The Challenge

The idea of this challenge shows the abilities to understand and engage with tasks. The challenge covers core functionality  which uses daily at Patchwork, including working with API’s, building reusable methods, displaying understanding of good design patterns, and the testing thereof.

##The Task

There were provided the API documentation to an open source cryptocurrency API. An application can perform the following:

###Task 1

Retrieve a list of cryptocurrencies given set of tickers
**Ie: Given an array of [‘BTC’, ‘XRP’, ‘ETH’]**
To get the full payload of those cryptocurrencies

###Task 2

Retrieve a (list) specific crypto currency and specific values based on the ticker and any other dynamic params
**Ie: It shows the [circulating_supply, max_supply, name, symbol, price] for [ETH, BTC]**

###Task 3

Retrieve a specific cryptocurrency to specific fiat. Ie: BTC in ZAR or ETH in USD

###Task 4

Calculate the price of one cryptocurrency from another, in relation to their dollar value
**Ie:  1BTC = $100, 1ETH = $50, therefore 1ETH == 0.5BTC**
